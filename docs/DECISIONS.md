# Project Decisions (Source of Truth)

This file freezes technical decisions so the implementation stays consistent across the team.
If a rule affects correctness, it must appear here.

---

## IDs and Types

- station_id: int (from stations.csv, never regenerated)
- vehicle_id: str (from vehicles.csv, never regenerated)
- user_id: int (generated incrementally by the system)
- ride_id: int (generated incrementally by the system)

IDs are never reused.

---

## Deterministic Vehicle Selection

When starting a ride at the selected station:

- Choose the eligible vehicle with the smallest number of rides since last treatment.
- In case of a tie, choose the vehicle with the smallest ID.

No randomness is allowed anywhere in the system.

---

## Distance Calculation

- Use Euclidean distance on (latitude, longitude) for all "nearest station" logic.
- If tie occurs, choose station with smallest station_id.

---

## Pricing

Phase 1:

- Fixed price of 15 ILS per ride.

Future phases:

- Additional pricing rules (e.g., degraded handling) will be implemented in Phase 2.

Pricing logic lives strictly in the service layer.

---

## Error Mapping (Service → API)

400:
Invalid input (schema/type/validation)

404:
Entity not found (user/vehicle/station/ride missing)

409:
Invalid state transition
(e.g., user already has active ride,
no eligible vehicles,
destination station full)

Service layer raises domain/service errors.
API layer translates them into HTTP responses.

---

## Persistence Strategy

Phase 1:

- Load initial state from CSV on startup.
- No saving of mutable runtime state.

Phase 2:

- Save/load mutable runtime state
  (vehicle status, degraded state, active rides if required).
- Restart behavior must not corrupt state.

---

## state.json Schema (Phase 2)

The runtime state is persisted to `state.json` after every mutating operation
and loaded on startup when the file exists.

### What is stored

Only runtime-generated or mutable data:

- Registered users (generated at runtime, not in CSV)
- Active rides (in-progress, not persisted in CSV)
- Completed rides history (for audit/billing history)
- Mutable vehicle fields (status, rides_since_last_treated, last_treated_date, station_id)
- Degraded repository vehicle IDs

Static data (station coordinates, vehicle type, initial CSV values) is NOT
duplicated in state.json. It is always re-read from CSV on startup.

### Field-level rules

**Datetime values** (start_time, end_time, saved_at):
- ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
- Naive local datetime (no timezone suffix), produced by `datetime.now()`

**Date values** (last_treated_date):
- ISO 8601 format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

**JSON object keys**:
- All ID-keyed maps use string keys (JSON requirement)
- Values carry the native typed field (e.g., `"user_id": 1` as int)

**vehicles.station_id**:
- Integer station_id if vehicle is docked
- `null` if vehicle is in an active ride or in the degraded repo

**degraded_repo**:
- Sorted lexicographically for deterministic output

**completed_rides**:
- Ordered by ride_id ascending for deterministic output

### Restoration procedure (Phase 2 bootstrap)

On startup, if `state.json` exists:

1. Load CSV (stations and vehicles) — provides static/base fields
2. Apply `vehicles` overrides — overwrite mutable fields for each vehicle_id
3. Restore `users` dict and `_registered_tokens` set
4. Restore `ActiveRidesRegistry` from `active_rides`
5. Rebuild `vehicle.active_ride_id` for each vehicle referenced in `active_rides` (this field is not stored in `vehicles` and must be derived)
6. Restore completed rides history from `completed_rides`
7. Restore `DegradedRepo` from `degraded_repo`
8. Rebuild station inventories: for each vehicle whose `station_id` is non-null in `vehicles`, add it to that station's inventory. Vehicles in active rides or in the degraded repo must not appear in any station inventory.
9. Set ID counters to `next_user_id` and `next_ride_id`

If `state.json` does not exist, fall back to Phase 1 CSV-only bootstrap.

### Invariants that must hold after restore

- Each vehicle exists in exactly one runtime location: a regular station inventory, the Active Rides registry, or the Degraded Repository
- Every vehicle_id in `active_rides` must have `station_id: null` in `vehicles`
- Every vehicle_id in `degraded_repo` must not appear in any station inventory
- All vehicle_ids referenced must exist in the vehicles CSV
- All station_ids referenced must exist in the stations CSV
- `next_ride_id > max(active ride IDs ∪ completed ride IDs)`
- `next_user_id > max(user IDs)`

---

## Fleet Invariants (Phase 1)

The following invariants must always hold during runtime.

---

## Vehicle Eligibility (Phase 1)

A vehicle is considered eligible (rentable) if:

- status == AVAILABLE
- active_ride_id is None
- rides_since_last_treated <= 10

Vehicle degradation rules:

- A vehicle becomes unrentable (degraded) if:
  - rides_since_last_treated > 10, or
  - a user reports it as degraded

Maintenance / treatment rules:

- Treatment may be initiated only on:
  - degraded vehicles, or
  - vehicles with rides_since_last_treated >= 7

Eligibility rules may expand in Phase 2, but the concept of eligibility remains centralized in the service layer.

---

## Station Membership Invariant

Regular stations must contain only eligible vehicles.

Vehicles that are not eligible must not remain in regular stations.

Specifically:

- Vehicles currently in ride belong to the Active Rides registry.
- Vehicles reported as degraded belong to the Degraded Repository.
- Vehicles with rides_since_last_treated > 10 belong to the Degraded Repository.

---

## Bootstrap Normalization Rule

On system startup (after CSV bootstrap):

FleetManager must validate all loaded vehicles and normalize system state:

- Ineligible vehicles must be removed from regular stations.
- Ineligible vehicles must be placed in the appropriate repository.
- Regular stations must end initialization containing only eligible vehicles.

This invariant must be maintained on every state transition
(start ride, end ride, maintenance handling).

---

## state.json Schema (Phase 2)

Defines the canonical JSON structure written to `state.json` during Phase 2 runtime persistence.
This document is the source of truth for serialization, deserialization, and restoration order.

### Field-Level Serialization Rules

- **Datetimes** (`start_time`, `end_time`, `saved_at`): ISO 8601 string with UTC `Z` suffix.
  Example: `"2026-03-10T14:20:00Z"`.
- **Dates** (`last_treated_date`): ISO 8601 date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`). No time component.
- **`station_id` in vehicles**: `null` when the vehicle is in an active ride or in the Degraded Repository.
  Never `null` for an eligible docked vehicle.
- **`active_ride_id` in vehicles**: `null` for all vehicles not currently in a ride.
- **`price` in rides**: `null` for active rides; a float for completed rides (may be `0.0` if degraded was reported).
- **Sort order**: all arrays are sorted by their primary key (`user_id`, `ride_id`, `vehicle_id`) in ascending order to produce deterministic snapshots.

---

### Restoration Procedure

Steps must be applied in this exact order to correctly reconstruct `FleetManager` state.

1. **Validate `schema_version`** — if the version is unrecognized, abort and raise an error. Do not attempt partial restoration.
2. **Restore `users`** — populate `FleetManager.users` dict keyed by `user_id`; register every `payment_token` into `_registered_tokens`.
3. **Restore ID counters** — set the internal `next_user_id` and `next_ride_id` counters to the persisted values so future allocations never produce a colliding ID.
4. **Restore `vehicles`** — reconstruct each `Vehicle` object (correct concrete subclass by `type`) with all persisted fields (`status`, `rides_since_last_treated`, `last_treated_date`, `station_id`, `active_ride_id`).
5. **Restore `active_rides`** — populate `ActiveRidesRegistry`; each ride must be indexed by `ride_id`, `user_id`, and `vehicle_id`.
6. **Restore `completed_rides`** — populate billing history in `BillingService`.
7. **Restore `degraded_repo`** — populate the `DegradedRepo` vehicle ID set from the persisted list.
8. **Rebuild station inventories** — clear all station `_vehicle_ids` sets first (so no CSV bootstrap inventory remains), then iterate over every vehicle: if `station_id` is not `null`, add the vehicle ID to that station's inventory. This step must run after steps 4 and 7 so that vehicles in rides (`active_ride_id` set) and vehicles in the degraded repo (`station_id` null) are correctly excluded.

---

### Post-Restore Invariants

After loading completes, all of the following must hold before the system handles any request:

- Every vehicle with a non-null `active_ride_id` has `station_id == null` and appears in `active_rides`.
- Every vehicle in `degraded_repo` has `status == DEGRADED` and `station_id == null`.
- Every eligible (non-degraded, non-in-ride) vehicle appears in exactly one station's inventory.
- No vehicle ID appears in more than one container (station or degraded repo) simultaneously.
- `next_user_id > max(user.user_id)` across all restored users (or `1` if no users exist).
- `next_ride_id > max(ride.ride_id)` across all active and completed rides (or `1` if no rides exist).
- The set of vehicle IDs in `degraded_repo` is exactly the set of vehicles that are either `status == DEGRADED` or `rides_since_last_treated > 10`.
